# Search Functionality Test Plan

## Changes Made

### 1. VehicleSearch Component
- Added `usePathname` to dynamically get the current route path
- Updated router.push to use `${pathname}?${params.toString()}` instead of hardcoded `/inventory`
- Added URL synchronization with useEffect to keep search term in sync with URL changes
- Added error handling with try-catch blocks

### 2. VehicleGrid Component
- Added comprehensive error handling in the filtering logic
- Added try-catch around individual vehicle filtering to prevent one bad entry from breaking all filtering
- Added validation for price range parsing (checking for NaN)
- Returns unfiltered vehicles if an error occurs during filtering

### 3. VehicleFilters Component
- Added `usePathname` for dynamic routing
- Updated all router.push calls to use current pathname
- Added error handling for filter updates and clearing

## Testing Steps

1. **Basic Search Test**
   - Navigate to the inventory page
   - Type in the search box
   - Verify URL updates with search parameter
   - Verify vehicles are filtered correctly

2. **URL Sync Test**
   - Manually change the URL search parameter
   - Verify search box updates to match
   - Navigate away and back with search params
   - Verify search state is preserved

3. **Filter Integration Test**
   - Apply search term
   - Apply location filter
   - Apply status filter
   - Apply price range
   - Verify all filters work together

4. **Error Handling Test**
   - Check console for any errors during filtering
   - Test with invalid price ranges
   - Test with special characters in search

5. **Performance Test**
   - Test with large vehicle list
   - Verify debouncing works (300ms delay)
   - Check for any UI lag

## Expected Behavior

- Search should update URL without full page reload
- Search state should persist across navigation
- All filters should work together seamlessly
- No console errors during normal operation
- Graceful handling of edge cases
