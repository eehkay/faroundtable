## Timeline Summary

**Progress to Date**:
- ‚úÖ Day 1: Navigation, Layout, Dashboard (COMPLETE)
- ‚úÖ Day 2: Inventory System (COMPLETE)
- ‚úÖ Day 3: Vehicle Detail Page & Design System Enhancement (COMPLETE)

**Remaining Work**: 1-2 days
- Day 4: User Management System (enable admin user control and notification setup)
- Day 5: Transfer Management System & Final Polish

**Current State**: The system is fully functional for inventory management with enhanced UI. Users can log in, navigate the app, browse vehicles with full search/filter capabilities, and view detailed vehicle information with real-time commenting and activity feeds. The design system has been significantly improved with better contrast and visual hierarchy. The next priority is implementing user management to enable proper admin control and notification setup before launching the transfer workflow.

This roadmap prioritizes getting a functional system deployed quickly while maintaining code quality and user experience standards.
