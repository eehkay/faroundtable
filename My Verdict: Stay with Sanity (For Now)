My Verdict: Stay with Sanity (For Now)

  Why?
  1. Migration Cost: You have a working system. The improvement isn't worth the migration effort right now
  2. Team Knowledge: Your team knows Sanity already
  3. It Works: Your current pain points aren't severe enough

  When to Consider Migration:
  - When you hit 10,000+ vehicles
  - When query performance becomes noticeable
  - When you need complex reporting/analytics
  - When you add more relational features (customer accounts, service history, etc.)

  If You Were Starting Today: Supabase

  For a new project with your requirements, I'd recommend Supabase because:
  1. Better performance at scale
  2. Lower costs
  3. More powerful query capabilities
  4. Better suited for relational data
  5. Built-in auth that works identically to NextAuth
  6. Edge Functions can handle your enrichment needs

  Hybrid Approach (Best of Both Worlds?)

  Consider keeping Sanity for:
  - CMS content (marketing pages, blog)
  - Image management (their CDN is excellent)

  And add Supabase for:
  - Vehicle inventory (core data)
  - User management
  - Analytics/reporting
  - Real-time features

  This would give you Sanity's excellent content management with Supabase's powerful database capabilities.

  Bottom Line: You didn't make a mistake. Sanity got you to market quickly. When performance or complex queries become a pain point,
  that's when a migration to Supabase would make sense. Until then, focus on growing the business!
